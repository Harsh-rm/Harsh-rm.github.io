It is very important for a human being to ask the question - who am I? This may sound silly or cliche but one has to be very serious in order to go deep into this question, to start off - 

The very answer might lie in the question itself, but that answer is not sufficient is it? Because the answer is just a verbal description of what is! One can come across this question if 
there is something so troubling that one is in pain or if one is so joyful that one starts to wonder how one got there!

So the mind is a place for thoughts and emotions, just like the world is a place for people, animals, plants, soil, and the very world itself. So one thinks of the mind as a place for thoughts, 
energy, memories, emotions, words, sounds and the mind itself.

When the question lies there in the abyss and if one really wants to know the answer to that question, one has to have the energy and the right attitude to start with. One can look at oneself 
in the mirror and observe what one was and what one has become. This going back and forth does not last, and the only thing which stays is this thing which we call consciousness - a state of 
being awake and aware of one’s surroundings. Therefore, it might be reason of not knowing, be the pruning of this question WHO AM I?

My story with a computer begins with me as a kid running up the stairs to my tenants' house so that I could sit the whole day and play video games back in 2005. They showed how you turn on the 
CPU on the bottom rack and the monitor would just go blue with the windows logo in the center of the screen. This would create an impulse in any child’s brain. So it did for me, made me so 
addicted to gaming that I wouldn’t go back home for lunch, until I could complete the mission (Call of Duty) or get away from the cops (NFS Most Wanted).
