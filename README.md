💭 Thought for the Month (Oct 2024) &emsp;=> Doing the same work every day is boring and no matter how far you might have travelled everything that you have known will collapse, so what's the meaning of life then? There is no fundamental answer, you've just got to live, grow and die. It's only our cycle of thoughts and questions that needs transformation to reflect any change in our daily living. <br><br>
